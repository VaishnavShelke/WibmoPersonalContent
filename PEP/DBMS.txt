INDEX Vs PRIMARY key
TRUNCATE Vs DELETE
VIEW provides encapsulation and abstraction // CREATE USER 'username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
											// GRANT SELECT ON your_database_name.employees TO 'username'@'localhost';
											// CREATE ROLE hr_role;
											// GRANT SELECT ON your_database_name.employees TO hr_role;
Data Abstraction :: View Level , Conceptual Level , Physical Level
Referential Integrity :  To allow join, the referential integrity rule states that the Primary Key and Foreign Key have same data types. 
Foreign keys exists only for referential integrity, Join can happen anyways
 CASCADE DELETE or CASCADE UPDATE
 M:M relationship requires a join table
 A foreing key should be mapped to unique index /primary key in another {Parent } table
 
Different Types of Database Keys,Candidate Key,Primary Key,Super Key,Alternate Key,Foreign Key,Composite Key
Primary keys are not necessarily to be a single column; more than one column can also be a primary key for a table.

Type of joins
Clustered Vs Non-Clustered Index - Remember that adding indexes can impact the performance of data modification operations (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), so it's essential to evaluate the trade-offs and consider the indexing strategy carefully based on your application's requirements and workload.
Sparse Vs Dense Indexing
